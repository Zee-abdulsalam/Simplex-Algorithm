Simplex Algorithm for Linear Programming
This project implements the Simplex Algorithm in C++ for solving linear programming problems. The program allows users to input constraints, an objective function, and computes an optimal solution using the tableau method. It supports maximization problems and provides a step-by-step approach to finding the best possible solution.

Features
✅ Accepts user input for constraints and objectives
✅ Constructs and manipulates the simplex tableau
✅ Identifies optimal solutions or detects unbounded problems
✅ Outputs the final solution and objective function value
